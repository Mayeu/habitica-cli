# Habitica CLI

This is a **:warning: proof-of-concept :warning:** of a CLI for Habitica.
Because of this, there is an high chance that it won't interest you at all

Right now it is fairly minimal and inflexible:
* There is no way to change the UID of the targeted task dynamically
* You must use the `pass(1)` password manager and have the api key in a very
  precise place.
* There is only the handful of commands that I use

## Install

You can install the script via Homebrew:
```
$ brew install mayeu/mayeu/habitica-cli
```
